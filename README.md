# Cryptio — Crypto Portfolio Tracker

A Spring Boot application to track spot balances across multiple exchanges  
(**Binance** and **Kraken** supported so far).

Balances are ingested via exchange APIs, normalized into a relational schema (managed by **Flyway**), and displayed on a simple **Thymeleaf front page**.

---

## Features

- 📊 View current holdings across accounts/exchanges
- 🔄 One-click **Fetch from Binance/Kraken** to update balances
- 🗄️ Schema managed with **Flyway** (separate H2/Postgres migrations)
- 🧩 Vendor-specific quirks (Kraken asset aliases, etc.) handled via `asset_alias`
- 🐳 Supports in-memory **H2** for dev, **Postgres** for prod
- 🔐 API keys provided via environment variables

You should see deltas shrink substantially. Remaining small differences typically come from:

Funding fee transfers (for margin/futures — if you only use spot, ignore),

Launchpool/Locked Earn nuances (more reward types; they also land in assetDividend),

Timing differences if snapshots were taken mid-flow.
